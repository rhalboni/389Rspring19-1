## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (45 pts)

flag: CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

after reading a couple of command injections articles on the internet I found it to be fairly easy to implement on the server. What I did was after running nc 1337bank.money 1337 it asks for a IP address. once the prompt shows, is the hackers opporunity to run a command injection. how you would do your command injection is rather than putting an ip address place a semi colon and after any linux command you want. At first i did it the hard way because i didn't know how to get to a shell, so i first ran a find command, something like thins'find --name 'flag*', where it returned the path /home/flag.txt. so my second time ncing into the server i ran a line of commands "; cd home; cat flag.txt" which gave me the name of this flag. after doing part 2 i found there was a much easier way to do the Part 1, and that was by running the shell from the bin directory.(; /bin/sh) the command put you automatically into a shell, and you dont have to all the hard work, of knowing exactly what you want to do. 

### Part 2 (55 pts)
for my stub.py I made a easy code which first connects to a the 1337 server using the socket library, after which prompts the user to enter one of four commands, shell, pull, help, and quit.
shell put you into an interactive shell of the server using command injection, and if you want to get out of the shell it is as easy as typing quit. nex is the pull command which has two arguments, one being path on the server, and the second being the path on your local file. This command copies your the information of the file you requested from the server and then opens the local file on your computer and writes puts the text in to  that file. help is a command that prints out the different commands the code has and a small description of what they do. and quit exits out of the code.

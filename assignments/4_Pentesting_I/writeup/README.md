## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (45 pts)

flag: CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

after reading a couple of command injections articles on the internet I found it to be fairly easy to implement on the server. What I did was after running nc 1337bank.money 1337 it asks for a IP address. once the prompt shows, is the hackers opporunity to run a command injection. how you would do your command injection is rather than putting an ip address place a semi colon and after any linux command you want. At first i did it the hard way because i didn't know how to get to a shell, so i first ran a find command, something like thins'find --name 'flag*', where it returned the path /home/flag.txt. so my second time ncing into the server i ran a line of commands "; cd home; cat flag.txt" which gave me the name of this flag. after doing part 2 i found there was a much easier way to do the Part 1, and that was by running the shell from the bin directory.(; /bin/sh) the command put you automatically into a shell, and you dont have to all the hard work, of knowing exactly what you want to do.

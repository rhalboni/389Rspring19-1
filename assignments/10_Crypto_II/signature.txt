"My name is Rami Halboni!"


Once you've created this file, use `gpg` to sign the file with this new imported
key and output it as `signature.txt.asc`. make sure to use the `--clearsign`
flag to produce an ASCII-armored output.

Upload only the `signature.txt.asc` file, and make sure it is named as such,
otherwise the grading script will NOT find it and properly, and you will not
receive credit for this part.
